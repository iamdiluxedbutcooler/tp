## Quick start

### 1. Install Java

Make sure you have **Java 17 or above** installed on your computer. You may skip this step if you already have it installed.

Installing Java:

* Download Java [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html). Follow the instructions on that page to install Java.

### 2. Download the AgentAssist application

Go to this [link](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/releases) and download the latest version of the `.jar` file.

### 3. Choose a Folder

Find or create a folder on your computer where you want to store the AgentAssist information. <br>
Move the `.jar` file you just downloaded into this folder.

### 4. Open a Command Terminal

Now, open a command terminal:

* On Windows, press the **Windows Key** and type **`Command Prompt`** in the search bar. Click on the **Command Prompt** application to open it.
* On macOS, press **Cmd + Space**, type **`Terminal`** into the search bar, and press **Enter**.
* On Linux, open your Terminal application.

### 5. Run the applicaton

Navigate your terminal to the folder where you saved the AgentAssist application:

* Type **`cd `** (with a space after it), then drag and drop the folder where you placed the `.jar` file into the terminal window. The command should look similar to this: `cd '/Users/name/AgentAssistFolder'`. Press Enter.<br>

Type the following command: **`java -jar agentassist.jar`** and press **Enter**.

* A window similar to the below image should appear in a few seconds. You will see a graphical user interface with sample contact information already added.<br>
  ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

### 6. Using AgentAssist

In the application window, you will see a **command box**. This is where you type commands to manage your contacts.

* Type a command in the command box and press **Enter** to make the app do something.
* Typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.

Here are some example commands you can try:

* `list` : Lists all contacts.
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
* `clear` : Deletes all contacts.
* `exit` : Exits the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) section for details of each command.

### Feature 5: Find a Customer by Details

**Purpose:**  
This feature allows users to search for customers by specific details such as name, address, email, phone number, job title, or remarks. 

**How to Use It:**  
To perform a search, use the `filter` command followed by a flag (indicating the field you want to search) and the corresponding search term. Searches are **case-insensitive** and use **substring-matching**. See [substring-matching](#substring-matching) to learn more. 

- **Command Format:** 
```
filter <FLAG>/ <SEARCH TERM>
```
- **Examples:** 
  - Filter customers by name: 
  ```
  filter n/ TAN LESHEW
  ```
  - Filter customers by job:
  ```
  e.g. filter j/ doctor
  ```

#### Parameters
| Parameter   | Expected Format                                                                                              | Explanation                                                                                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FLAG        | Refer to the list of supported flags detailed below.                                                         | Identifies the field to search (e.g., `n/` for name, `j/` for job).|                                                                          |
| SEARCH TERM | Refer to the syntax constraints in the [parameter subsection of the `add` command](#add-command-parameters). | The value to search for in the specified field (e.g., "doctor" for job, "TAN LESHEW" for name).         |

#### Supported flags:
- `n/` for Name
- `p/` for Phone Number
- `e/` for Email
- `a/` for Address
- `j/` for Job
- `r/` for Remarks

#### Substring Matching:
- Substring matching is used for searches, meaning that the search term must match a part of the field in the same order as it appears in the customer record.
- For instance, if a customerâ€™s name is "John Lee", the search term "John", "Lee", or "John Lee" will match, but "Lee John" will not.


#### What to Expect

  - Message: "Here are all the customers that match your search: (List of customers)."
- **If Unsuccessful (No Matches Found):**
  - Message: "No customers match your search criteria."
- **If Multiple Filters Are Used:**
  - Message: "Using multiple filters is not supported yet. Please use only one filter."
- **If There is an Error:** 
  - No Valid Flags Used:
    - Message:
    
      "filter: Searches for all customers whose specified field contains the given
    substring (case-insensitive) and displays the results in a numbered list.
    
      Parameters: `<FLAG>/ <SEARCH TERM>`
      
      Flags: `n/` (name), `p/` (phone), `e/` (email), `a/` (address), `j/` (job), `r/` (remarks)
      
      Example: `filter n/ Alice`
    
      This will find all customers whose names contain 'Alice'."
  - If Search Term Fails to Meet Requirement (i.e. Phone Number longer than 8 digits):
    - The system will display usage hints specific to the first invalid search term.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.
**Q**: How do I change the remarks or credit card tier of an existing customer?<br>
**A**: Use the [`edit`](#feature-4-edit-the-existing-customer) command, and specify the corresponding `t/` and or `rn/` or `ra/` flag to change these two fields.
**Q**: Why am I getting an error when trying to edit the remark of an existing customer?
**A**: Besides making sure that the command syntax is correct, please note that the `rn/` and `ra/` flags cannot be used together, as `rn/` is used to provide a new remark that will override any existing remark. Whilst, `ra/` will append a given remark to any existing remark. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
